js-y86
======

**MODIFIED BY JONATHAN GLUCK FOR CMSC216**

js-y86 is an assembler and simulator written in Javascript. It supports:

-	All of the original y86 instructions plus cmovX
-	Breakpoints via `brk`
-	Step-by-step execution
-	Inspect the contents of the registers, flags, and memory after every instruction
-	Manually pause if you get stuck in an infinite loop
-	Syntax highlighting
-	See your (hopefully useful) compile errors as you type

[See it in action](https://jdg.github.io/js-y86/) or [read the documentation on the Wiki](https://github.com/jdg/js-y86/wiki).
